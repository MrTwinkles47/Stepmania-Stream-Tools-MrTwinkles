Request status indicator is something that you can use to help your stream understand if you are accepting requests currently or not. It has some configuration options in CSS that allow you to place it anywhere and have it go with your stream.

* Within OBS, create a new browser source with whatever size allocation you would like to alot for the indicator
* Use the address https://[URL]/stats.php?data=requestStatus&broadcaster=[TwitchName]
* Configure your desired display CSS in the Custom CSS window in OBS

	CSS options are:
```css
.statusOFF { background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 255); color: Yellow;}
.statusON { background-color: rgba(120, 255, 50, 255); color: Black;}
.outputOFF { color: White; }
.outputON { color: Blue; }
```

##### Configuring Scrolling End Screen Statistics

Scrolling End Screen Statistics allows you to give a comprehensive list of the requested songs, requestor, score acheived, and any awards associated with the score obtained during the requested play.

* Within OBS, create a new browser source with whatever size allocation you would like to alot for the scrolling list
* Use the address https://[URL]/stats.php?data=EndScreenScroll&judgement=itg
 **Note**: Judgement should be either ITG or DDR depending on your theme

  /* animation properties */
  /* Negative (-200%) for top to bottom. Positive (100%) for bottom to top */
  -moz-transform: translateY(100%);
  -webkit-transform: translateY(100%);
  transform: translateY(100%);
  
  /* Modify the time to speed up or slow down the scroll speed */
  /* Change animation between top-to-bottom-animation or bottom-to-top-animation */
  -moz-animation: bottom-to-top-animation 30s linear infinite;
  -webkit-animation: bottom-to-top-animation 30s linear infinite;
  animation: bottom-to-top-animation 30s linear infinite;
}
